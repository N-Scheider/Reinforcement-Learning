## Abstract

The repository contains assignments from the Reinforcement Learning Course held by Prof. Knochenhauer in the Wintersemester 2024/25 at Technical University Munich (TUM).
The BONUS files were part of an exam bonus where the student was asked to implement a Portfolio balancing scheme. This was mainly done by establishing all potential payoffs first and then by iterating back in time and optimizing the Bellman Equation via the control strategy.
